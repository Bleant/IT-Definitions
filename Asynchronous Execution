Asynchronous execution differs from usual execution in that it does not block (0), that is, it does not wait for requests to be completed,
other requests may be made while previous ones are handled. How they are handled in the background depends on factor such as programming
language and what the request is bound (1) to.

I/O bound processes as requests may and mostly will not require the creation of new threads to be dealt with, as they depend on the disk,
and not on machine instructions.

(0) Add blocking definition and link to it.

(1) Add bound processes definitions and links to them.
